Architectures vs. checkpoints

Architecture: This is the skeleton of the model — the definition of each layer and each operation that happens within the model.
Checkpoints: These are the weights that will be loaded in a given architecture.
Model: This is an umbrella term that isn’t as precise as “architecture” or “checkpoint”: it can mean both. This course will specify architecture or checkpoint when it matters to reduce ambiguity
